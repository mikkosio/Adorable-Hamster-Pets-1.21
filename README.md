Let's go back to the beginning. You looked upon your blocky domain, surveyed your automated farms spewing resources you probably don't need, your enchanted gear shimmering with overkill, your… unique architectural choices, and declared, "Needs more rodents."

Or maybe you didn't. Doesn't matter. You're here now, considering adding hamsters to a world already teeming with exploding plants and questionable physics. A truly inspired decision.

**Adorable Hamster Pets** introduces, against potentially better judgment, hamsters to Minecraft. Tiny, fuzzy, occasionally helpful, frequently underfoot creatures destined to become your new favorite source of minor inventory clutter. They squeak, bounce, fly... if you throw them... and silently judge your life choices from the questionable safety of your shoulder. You can tame them (if you're patient), feed them various vegetable concoctions (results may vary), and even launch them in an attack. (Consult your local ethics committee. Or don't. I'm not your conscience).

<summary>🎨 Biome Variants & Genetics</summary>

..........................

Prepare for a veritable explosion of fur colors! With nine base coats and eight overlay patterns (plus the unique White color), there are a staggering **73 possible hamster variants** to discover. Hamsters found shivering in snowy plains look different from those basking in deserts. Shocking, I know. They even pass these stunningly diverse palettes on to their offspring, with a polite attempt to not *exactly* copy their parents' white overlay patterns, ensuring maximum genetic *variety* in your pocket pet population.

**A Field Guide to Hamster Habitats (Sort Of):**
*   **Orange & Cream:** Often found sunning themselves in Plains, Savannas, Deserts, and non-frigid Beaches. Badlands also seem to attract the Orange ones.
*   **Chocolate:** Prefers the shaded canopy of Forests and non-snowy Taigas (excluding Cherry Groves, those are special).
*   **Black:** Enjoys the damp ambiance of Swamps and the mysterious depths of Lush and Dripstone Caves.
*   **Light Gray & Dark Gray:** These stoic shades are common in mountainous regions (that aren't actively trying to freeze them) and also share cave real estate with their Black brethren.
*   **White:** Exclusively found in most Snowy biomes (Plains, Taiga, Groves, etc.) and makes up about 30% of the population in the extremely chilly Ice Spikes.
*   **Blue:** A rare sight, these cool-colored critters are rumored to only appear in the frigid, pointy landscape of Ice Spikes (about a 70% chance if you find a hamster there).
*   **Lavender:** Another elusive variant, said to exclusively inhabit the picturesque but specific biome of Cherry Groves.

*(Disclaimer: Hamster spawn location preferences are subject to change based on developer whims and biome generation quirks. Happy collecting!)*

<summary>🤝 Taming & Sitting</summary>

..........................

Bribe them with enough Sliced Cucumber, and they'll follow you like a furry, ankle-biting shadow. Right-click to make them sit, lest they develop a sudden fascination with the nearest lava pool. Again.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>😴 Advanced Napping Protocols</summary>

..........................

Tamed hamsters, when left sitting, might just decide it's naptime. Watch as they gradually drift off through an elaborate "Path to Slumber" sequence, complete with unique animations for dozing, settling, and several adorable deep sleep poses. Their dedication to slumber is even configurable!

Wild hamsters also have a rather bouncy transition into their naps.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🎭 Unique Animation Personalities</summary>

..........................

Not all hamsters are created equal. Upon birth, each hamster is assigned one of three "personalities," which determines the specific sitting and dozing off animations it will use for its entire life. One might be a prim and proper sitter, while another is a bit more of a sloucher. It's a small touch to make your specific furry companion feel even more unique.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🧀 Shoulder Surfing— with *Perks*</summary>
..........................

Lure your nearest owned hamster onto your shoulder with the irresistible siren call of **Cheese**. (Or if you prefer boring explanations: right-click them with it). They'll offer helpful alerts about nearby Creepers and possibly valuable shiny rocks that start with a D, and rhyme with Simon. Kind of. They almost rhyme. Whatever. Complete with "scurrying onto your shoulder" and "leaping off in a huff" sound effects.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>💎 Furry Freelance Prospecting</summary>
..........................

So, your shoulder-mounted furball just made a series of excited squeaks and sniffs, hinting at nearby diamonds? Excellent. Now for the fun part. Dismount your tiny prospector. If it was indeed onto something shiny, it might just take matters into its own feet.

Watch as it attempts to lead you to the alleged riches, complete with sniffing animations, determined dust-sniffing particles (that cleverly match the ground below, because details💅🏼), and a soundtrack of focused sniffs. 

If its path is blocked, it'll patiently (or impatiently, it's hard to tell) wait, hoping you'll clear the way. Upon reaching its target, it'll celebrate with cool particle effects and a chorus of happy bounces (with sound!).

But be warned: sometimes, in their eagerness, these little geologists might get a tad confused about what exactly constitutes a "valuable shiny rock." If it unearths something... less diamond-y and more... not-quite-diamond-ish... prepare for a dramatic sulk, complete with its own unique animation, sound effects, and a display of utter disappointment. A quick pat should snap it out of its angst.

This whole ore-seeking escapade is, of course, configurable.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>👜 Cheek Pouches of Holding</summary>

..........................

Yes, inventory... *in their face*. Feed them **Hamster Food Mix** once to earn their trust (and cheek access!), then Sneak + Right-click a tamed hamster for 6 slots of prime real estate. No, you can't stuff a Netherite block in there. They'll even automatically scarf down **Hamster Food Mix** from their cheeks if they take a tumble, after a brief, dramatic pause to consider their options. Can't make them *too* overpowered.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>💥 Hamster Kung Fu Techniques</summary>

..........................

*   **Melee:** They'll energetically implement hamster kung fu on things that hurt you, or things you decide to hurt first. Valiant, if statistically unimpressive. Complete with crit particles on impact!
*   **The Hamster Yeet™:** Press **'G'** (by default - check your keybinds if you're just flailing your arms) while *not* staring intently at a block. Behold as your shoulder companion becomes a surprisingly effective, albeit concussed, projectile. Does enough damage by default to kill a creeper, which is... really convenient. Gentle interaction (a pat, a click, whatever) required for post-impact recovery.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🌸 Decorate Your Hamsters</summary>

..........................

Found some **Pink Petals**? Right-click your tamed hamster to bestow upon it a stylish floral accessory. Not feeling that particular look? Click again with petals to cycle through a few options. Regret your decision entirely? A quick snip with **Shears** will undo your fashionable folly (and you even get the petal back, because I'm nice like that).

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🌿 New Questionable Flora</summary>

..........................

*   **Wild Cucumber & Green Bean Bushes:** Find these lurking in specific biomes. *(See the Hamster Guide book for details.)* Right-click the seeded ones for seeds. Try not to step on them. They now spawn without needing a specific light level, so happy cave gardening!
*   **Slightly Less Useless Sunflowers:** Sunflowers have had an upgrade. These look like vanilla ones, but these actually *do* something. Right-click the top block when it looks seeded for **Sunflower Seeds**. They regrow. Eventually. Patience is a virtue. Isn't that right, John?

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🥕 Exciting New Foodstuffs</summary>

..........................

*   **Cucumber/Green Beans:** Grow 'em, eat 'em raw (if you must), slice 'em, steam 'em. Culinary possibilities are… present.
*   **Steamed Green Beans:** A suspiciously potent super-food for your hamster. Grants temporary buffs, followed by a mandatory "please wait" period. Don't get greedy.
*   **Hamster Food Mix:** Allegedly gourmet. Heals well, bypasses their irritating pickiness, and is the key to unlocking their cheek pouches. Craft it. Or don't. Your hamster, your problem.
*   **Cheese:** Not only can it lure hamsters onto your shoulder, it's player-edible. Surprisingly nutritious (think cooked porkchop levels) and you can scarf it down about 30% faster than most foods. The only catch? The... *distinctively moist* eating sound. Consider it an acquired taste.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 The Hamster Tips Guide Book</summary>

..........................

You get one automatically the first time you join a world with this mod (unless you turned that off in the config, you rebel). It contains *hints*. Read it. Or use it as kindling. See if I care. Lost it? Craft another with a Book and some Sliced Cucumber. Don't ask why Sliced Cucumber. It's a long story.

..........................
</details>

<details>
<summary>🏆 Immersive Advancements</summary>

..........................

*   A custom advancements tab, "The Hamster Life," guides you through the thrilling world of hamster husbandry, from finding your first seed to... well, yeeting. (Thanks to `@MylesGit` on GitHub for the original advancement tree suggestion!)

## <font color="teal">Getting Started (The "Bla Bla How Do I Make It Squeak?" Guide)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

1.  **Go Outside:** Wander aimlessly through Plains, Savannas, Forests, Swamps, etc., until you trip over **Wild Cucumber Bushes** or **Wild Green Bean Bushes**. Right-click the ones that look like they have seeds. Collect said seeds.
2.  **Pretend to Farm:** Plant seeds on farmland. Wait. Harvest. Try not to starve while waiting for virtual vegetables.
3.  **Questionable Crafting:** Turn Cucumbers into **Sliced Cucumber** (the bait). Turn Green Beans into **Steamed Green Beans** via furnace (for buffs). Cobble together various seeds and carrots into **Hamster Food Mix** (for healing). Turn Milk into **Cheese** (the Shoulder Shenanigans starter kit). Refer to your recipe book, I'm not writing recipes here.
4.  **Attempt Taming:** Find a wild hamster. **Sneak**. Hold **Sliced Cucumber**. Approach like you're diffusing a tiny, furry bomb. Click. Repeat until successful or rage-quit.
5.  **Basic Hamster Operations:** Right-click to sit/stand. Sneak + Right-click for cheek inventory access (after feeding Food Mix!). Wave Cheese around to shoulder-mount. Crouch to dismount, or Press 'G' to dismount... *assertively*.

## <font color="teal">How to Contact Me</font>

Alright, let's be real. Sometimes things break. Sometimes hamsters exhibit behavior that even *I* can't explain (looking at you, hamster #37, who tried to eat a sign). And sometimes you, my friend, might have a stroke of genius that could elevate this mod from "questionably charming" to "quite good."

Here's how to get in touch. And yes, I'm probably going to regret at least one of these options.

*   **The Official, Sensible Routes (Preferred for Bugs & Features):**
    *   **[GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/DawsonBodenhamer/Adorable-Hamster-Pets-1.21/issues):** This is the best place for bug reports and feature suggestions. I actually check it. Frequently. It helps keep things organized, and other people can see if their issue is already known.
    *   **[Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf):** Come hang out, share pictures of your hamsters, or get help in real-time. It's organized chaos, and you're invited. 

*   **The "I Need to Talk to a Human" Options:**
    *   [**Email:**](mailto:dawson@fortheking.design) - For when GitHub feels too impersonal, or you want to send me digital fan mail (or virtual rotten tomatoes).
    *   [**Website:**](https://www.fortheking.design) - Check out my other stuff! Fair warning, it's mostly graphic design. If you see a distinct lack of hamsters, that's why.
    *   [**Instagram:**](https://www.instagram.com/artist.for.the.king/) - Theatrical sword-fighting shenanigans, less digital rodents. But hey, pretty pictures!
    *   **Personal Phone Number (Yes, really. For now.):** 903-747-7268 - Look, I want to make this mod awesome, and direct feedback helps. I reserve the right to remove this if my phone spontaneously combusts from notifications or if I start getting calls at 3 AM about hamster existential crises. Text is definitely best. Use this power wisely. Or don't. We'll see how this goes.

## <font color="teal">Bug Reporting Etiquette (Please, I Beg You):</font>

If you're reporting a bug, to save both our sanities, try to include:

1.  **What You Were Doing:** (e.g., "I was trying to teach my hamster to yodel while riding a pig backwards during a thunderstorm...")
2.  **What You Expected to Happen:** (e.g., "...and I expected it to hit a high C, or at least not phase through the floor.")
3.  **What Actually Happened:** (e.g., "...but instead, it turned into a turnip and started quoting Shakespeare. Also, my game crashed.")
4.  **Minecraft Version, Mod Version, Fabric Loader/API Versions:** Usually found in the top of your crash report or your mod list.
5.  **Crash Report (If Applicable):** Use a site like [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), or [Mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) and give me the link. **Do NOT paste the whole thing into a GitHub comment or email.** My scroll wheel will thank you.
6.  **Pro Tip (For Crash Reports):** To make your life (and mine) infinitely easier, consider installing the [**Crash Assistant**](https://modrinth.com/mod/crash-assistant) mod. It's a client-side utility that pops up after a crash and gives you a one-click button to upload all relevant logs. It's not required, but it's *highly* recommended.
7.  **Screenshots/Videos (If Helpful):** A picture (or better yet, a screen recording) is worth a thousand lines of confused log reading.
8.  ### **👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 Hamster Debug Info (Jade Mod):**
    *   If you have the [**Jade mod**](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) installed, my mod includes a special debug overlay for hamsters.
    *   **To toggle this overlay:** Sneak and Right-Click a **tamed** hamster while holding the **Hamster Guide Book**. *(You can craft the guidebook with a Book + Sliced Cucumber).* An action bar message will confirm if it's enabled or disabled.
    *   Alternatively, you can enable/disable it in the "Adorable Hamster Pets" config screen (Mod Menu -> Adorable Hamster Pets -> UI & Quality of Life -> "Enable Jade Hamster Debug Info").
    *   If your bug involves hamster behavior or animations, please try to capture a screenshot or video with this debug overlay visible while looking at the affected hamster. Knowing the states shown in this overlay (e.g., "Current Custom Goal," "Sitting," "Dozing Phase") is extremely helpful for diagnosing issues!

The more info you give, the less I have to guess, and the faster things might get fixed.

Fun fact: I've already implemented new features like the custom advancement tree and config toggles for the hamster guidebook based on suggestions from my Github! We move quick around here.

## <font color="teal">Dependencies (Stuff You Need Besides Questionable Life Choices)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

*   **Minecraft:** 1.21.1 (Or whatever version this file says it's for)
*   **Fabric Loader:** >=0.16.10 (Or newer, probably)
*   **Fabric API:** (*) (The big one. You need this.)
*   **GeckoLib:** 4.7.3 (For the wiggles and jiggles. Essential.)
*   **Fzzy Config:** 0.6.x+1.21 (Bundled, mostly for the config screen you might ignore, unless you're nerdy like me and like to change the settings.)
</details>

## <font color="teal">Forge and Neoforge Compatibility</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

This mod is officially developed for **Fabric**. That's where it's built, tested, and guaranteed to work as intended (or as intended as a mod about throwable hamsters can be).

However, thanks to the tireless work of the Sinytra Connector team and a tip from Reddit user [`aussiedutchlover`](https://www.reddit.com/user/aussiedutchlover/), you can get this mod running on **NeoForge** right now. I've tested it myself, and it works!

**To run on NeoForge, you will need:**
*   **Adorable Hamster Pets** (the regular Fabric version)
*   [**Sinytra Connector**](https://modrinth.com/mod/sinytra-connector) (The magic that bridges the gap)
*   [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) (The Fabric API, but for Forge/NeoForge)
*   All of this mod's other dependencies (like GeckoLib and Fzzy Config), but their **NeoForge versions**.

Here's a screenshot of my exact testing setup: <p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/geJY9hA.png" alt="Adorable Hamster Pets Banner Image" width="2000"/> </p>

**The Big Disclaimer:** While this workaround is functional, it is **unofficial**. I do not officially support NeoForge yet. If you run into bugs while using Connector, please mention it in your bug report, but be aware that some issues may be outside of my control.

Official ports to NeoForge and/or Forge are on the agenda, but for now, this is your best bet for cross-loader hamster shenanigans.

## <font color="teal">Installation (The Annoying But Necessary Bit)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

1.  Install Fabric Loader if you haven't already.
2.  Install Fabric API, Geckolib.
3.  Download the Adorable Hamster Pets `.jar` file. From where you got *this* file, presumably.
4.  Shove the `.jar` file into your `mods` folder. If you don't know where that is, maybe modding isn't for you.
5.  Launch Minecraft. Brace yourself.
6.  Briefly question the series of events that led you to installing a mod primarily focused on hamsters.
</details>

---

## <font color="teal">Configuration (For Those Who Like to Tinker)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

Uses Fzzy Config for configuration. If you have Mod Menu, click the button. If not, venture into the `config/adorablehamsterpets` folder and edit `config.toml` by hand like some kind of digital caveman. Tweak spawn rates, cooldowns, sleep behaviors, maybe disable the throwing if you have a shred of empathy left. Defaults are probably fine. Probably. The config screen has been reorganized for your viewing pleasure (or confusion).

## <font color="teal">Future Plans (The Ever-Expanding Hamster Agenda)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

The hamster wheel of "progress" never truly stops. Here's a peek at what might be scurrying out of the development pipeline, eventually:

*   **Version Voracity:** Your hamsters aim to colonize future Minecraft 1.21.x versions. Subject to API whims and developer sanity.
*   **Expressive Idling:** More random, charming animations (like head-tilts) to make idle hamsters feel a bit more alive and less like furry paperweights.
*   **Turbo Hamster Mode:** A new, faster "sprint" animation for when your hamster is *really* motivated (e.g., by buffs or a particularly tempting treat).
*   **The Art of Cheese:** The current milk-to-cheese recipe is placeholder. Expect a more involved, thematically appropriate cheese-making process in the future.
*   **More Hamster Skins:** Expanding the variety of white overlay patterns for even more unique-looking companions.
*   **Shoulder Sync with Animation Mods:** Investigating better visual integration of the shoulder hamster when using player animation overhaul mods like "Fresh Animations." This is complex and depends on external factors.
*   **The "Snack of Yestermouth":** A peculiar item formed when multiple food types are left in a hamster's cheek pouch for an extended period (accelerated by rotten flesh). Its purpose? Still under... *fermentation*. It will likely serve a unique, helpful, if slightly gross, function.

*(Disclaimer: These are ideas, not ETAs. Development is a chaotic process, much like trying to give a hamster a bath.)*

## <font color="teal">License (The Legal Blah Blah - But Actually Read This Bit)</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand. It's less boring than it sounds. Mostly.</summary>

Alright, let's talk about who owns what and what you can (and absolutely cannot) do with "Adorable Hamster Pets." It's a bit like a timeshare, but with more fur and less obligation to attend a sales pitch.

## **The Gist (for Humans):**

*   ### **My Pretty Pictures & Squeaky Sounds (The Assets):**
    *   This includes all the hamster models, their fabulous fur textures, the delightful (or terrifying) animations, every custom sound effect that makes you jump, the block/item textures. Basically, anything in the `/src/main/resources/` folder of the mod.
    *   **License:** © 2025 Dawson Bodenhamer ([**www.ForTheKing.Design**](https://www.fortheking.design/)). **All Rights Reserved.**
    *   **What that means:** You can enjoy the hamsters in the mod, show them off in your videos (please do, and a little credit is always nice!), but please don't grab them to use in your own projects, mods, or try to redistribute them separately. Think of it as an art gallery – admire, enjoy, don't walk out with the paintings.


* ### **The Brains of the Operation (The Code):**
    *   This is all the clever (and occasionally questionable) Java code that makes the hamsters run, sniff, yeet, and generally cause delightful chaos. This is most of what's in the `/src/main/java/` folder, plus things like build scripts.
    *   **License:** **MIT License.**
    *   **What that means:** If you're a fellow code-wrangler, you're welcome to peek under the hood. You can learn from it, modify it for your *personal* use, and even use snippets in your own open-source Fabric mod projects, **as long as you include my original copyright notice and a copy of the MIT License text.** It's like an open-source cookbook – use the recipe, give the original chef a nod. You still can't use my pretty dinner plates (the assets) without asking, though.

## **TL;DR Version:**
*   **Play the mod?** Yeppers.
*   **Make videos/streams?** Big yep.
*   **Use my hamster images/sounds in your own stuff?** Nope, ask first.
*   **Look at/learn from/tweak the code for your own fun or compatible open-source mod (and give credit)?** Go for it.
*   **Re-upload the mod somewhere else?** Definitely not. Get it from official sources (like Modrinth).
*   **Sell the mod?** The Minecraft EULA says *I* can't even do that, and you shouldn't either.

For the full, legally-binding-but-hopefully-still-understandable text that lawyers apparently enjoy, please see the `LICENSE.md` file included with the mod. If you're thinking of doing something not covered here, especially regarding modpacks or asset use, just reach out and ask! I'm generally pretty reasonable, unless you try to precisely replace all my hamsters with sentient cabbages. Then we might have words.

## <font color="teal">Hat Tip to the Hamster Trailblazers</font>
<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

Apparently, putting tiny digital rodents into Minecraft is a shared ambition. While figuring out how to make these particular fuzzballs look less like sentient bread loaves, the general aesthetic of the **Hamsters mod** by **Starfish Studios** served as an early visual reference point. It's a different spin on hamsters, focusing on things like hamster wheels and redstone, last seen conquering Minecraft 1.20.1.

You can check out their handiwork here:

*   [**Starfish Studios' Hamsters Mod (Modrinth)**](https://modrinth.com/mod/hamsters)
*   [**Starfish Studios Website**](https://starfish-studios.com/)

**Standard Procedure Disclaimer:** Just to be clear, **Adorable Hamster Pets** is its own beast (well, rodent). All the assets you see here – models, textures, animations, code, questionable sounds – were built independently from the ground up *for this mod*. I appreciate the inspiration, went off and did my own thing entirely, and naturally respect their All Rights Reserved license on their assets.

### Now go enjoy the squeaks. Or mute them. Whatever.
