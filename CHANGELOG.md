## [1.2.1] - 2025-06-12

### Fixed
- Resolved a critical crash that would occur when exiting a world to the main menu. This was caused by the mod attempting to send network packets after the connection to the server had already closed.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-11

### Added
- **Jade Integration for Wild Bush Tooltips:** Custom tooltips for Wild Green Bean Bushes and Wild Cucumber Bushes now appear in Jade's overlay if Jade is installed, mirroring their item tooltips.
- **Jade Integration for Hamster Debug Info (Configurable):**
  - Added an advanced debug information overlay for Hamsters when viewed with Jade.
  - Displays detailed AI states (current custom goal, sitting status, navigation, target), sleep sequence phases, love/interaction states, and general info like variant and age.
  - This feature is primarily for debugging and is **disabled by default**.
  - Can be toggled via a new option in the mod's config screen (Mod Menu -> Adorable Hamster Pets -> UI & Quality of Life -> "Enable Jade Hamster Debug Info").
  - Can also be toggled in-game by sneak-right-clicking a tamed hamster while holding the Hamster Guide Book. An action bar message confirms the toggle.
  - This Hamster Debug Info Jade integration is **AWESOME** for myself when bug fixing, but also for anyone reporting bugs (see `README`, "Bug Reporting Etiquette" section).
- **Independent Ore Seeking Feature:**
  - Tamed hamsters, after being on a player's shoulder while a diamond alert was active, can now independently seek out *that* diamond ore upon dismount.
  - Features new AI goal (`HamsterSeekDiamondGoal`) with distinct states: scanning, moving to ore, and waiting if path is blocked.
  - **Whoops! Who Put That There?** (There's a 33% chance a primed hamster targeting diamond might "mistakenly" pathfind to nearby gold ore instead. If this happens the hamster will be shocked and start sulking.)
  - **New Animations:**
    - `anim_hamster_seeking_diamond`: Looping animation for when the hamster is actively moving towards an ore.
    - `anim_hamster_wants_to_seek_diamond`: Looping animation for when the hamster has targeted an ore but its path is blocked.
    - `anim_hamster_sulk` (3s, non-looping) & `anim_hamster_sulking` (looping): Played if the hamster "mistakenly" finds gold.
  - **New Sounds & Effects:**
    - Dust particles (colored like the block the hamster is on) emit from the hamster's nose via animation keyframes while seeking.
    - Upon finding diamond: "Diamond sparkle" sounds play at the ore, special particles (`TRIAL_SPAWNER_DETECTION_OMINOUS` on hamster, `FIREWORKS` above ore) appear, and the hamster plays the begging animation with new "bounce" sound effects triggered by animation keyframes. Aggressive begging sounds also play periodically.
    - Upon "mistakenly" finding gold: A delayed orchestral hit (`alarm_orchestra_hit.ogg`) plays, followed by a delayed "hamster shocked" sound. Smoke particles appear above the gold ore, and black entity effect particles appear on the sulking hamster.
  - **Interaction:** Player right-click clears diamond celebration or sulking states, with new "affection" sounds.
  - **Configuration:** New options in Mod Menu to toggle the feature, its cooldown, and ore scan radius.
  - **Advancement:** New "Canine Aspirations?" advancement for when a hamster first successfully leads to diamond.
- **Jade Debug Overlay Enhancements:** The Jade debug overlay for hamsters now displays new states related to ore seeking (primed status, target ore, cooldown) and the sulking/celebrating diamond states.
- **New Sound Events:** Added `hamster_bounce`, `alarm_orchestra_hit`, `hamster_shocked`, `diamond_sparkle1-3`, and `hamster_affection1-3` sound events and their definitions.
- **Animation Personalities:** Tamed hamsters are now assigned one of three persistent "personalities" at birth, which determines the specific sitting animations they will use for their entire life, making each hamster feel more unique.
- **Configurable Cleaning Frequency:** Added a new option in the config ("Cleaning Frequency") to control how often a sitting hamster will start its cleaning animation.

### Changed
- **Hamster Blinking is Cuter:** Removed the code-based procedural blinking logic for `HamsterEntity`. Eye blinking and closure are now entirely controlled by keyframes within the GeckoLib animations (`anim_hamster.json`), allowing for cuter and more context-aware blinking (e.g., slower blinks when sleepy).
- Updated `README.md` to include instructions for players on how to use and provide the new Jade Hamster Debug Info when reporting bugs.
- **Hamster AI for Following Owner:** Implemented `HamsterFollowOwnerGoal` in order to prevent hamsters from trying to follow their owner while they are celebrating a diamond find or sulking at gold (in addition to existing interruptions like sitting, sleeping, KO).
- **Hamster AI for Looking Around:** `HamsterLookAtEntityGoal` and `HamsterLookAroundGoal` are now disabled when a hamster is knocked out, sitting, or sulking, preventing rotation during this state.
- **Diamond Celebration Behavior:** Hamsters now also use the begging animation when celebrating a diamond find.
- **Begging Animation:** The begging animation has been updated to include keyframe-driven bounce sounds.
- **Dependency Declarations:** Updated `fabric.mod.json` to correctly declare hard dependencies on GeckoLib and owo-lib (now in `depends` section) and list ModMenu and Jade as optional (now in `suggests` section). This improves server compatibility and clarifies requirements for users and modpack creators.
- **Guidebook Update:** Added a new page to the "Hamster Tips" guidebook detailing the "Independent Ore Seeking" feature, including how to prime a hamster for it.
- ### Switched from owo-lib to Fzzy Config, which means lots of awsesome new config features, including change history and the ability to search for specific settings!
- **Footstep Sound System Overhaul:** Hamster footstep sounds now use a hybrid system to improve immersion.
  - When a hamster is on-screen, it uses precise, animation-keyframed sounds that are perfectly synchronized with its footfalls.
  - When a hamster is off-screen (and thus not animating for the client), it uses the traditional vanilla (server-side) movement-based sounds as a fallback. This ensures you can always hear your companions following you.
- **Sound Volume Balancing:**
  - Footstep sounds on gravel are now 40% quieter to better match the volume of sounds on other surfaces like grass and stone.
  - The volume of begging sounds has been reduced.
- **Cleaning Animation Sound:** The cleaning animation now features a continuous, looping scratch sound. Fun fact— it's actually the sound of me scratching my beard 🤭

### Legal
- **License Update & Clarification:** Updated the project license to a split model (see `LICENSE.md`).
  - Creative assets (models, textures, sounds, animations found in `/src/main/resources/`) are now **All Rights Reserved** to better protect the significant artistic effort invested. When "Adorable Hamster Pets" started nearly six months ago as what I thought would be a small weekend project, an MIT license seemed fine. I was so young and innocent of Javascript then. Lol.
  - The Java source code and other non-asset files remain under the **MIT License**, allowing for community learning and code-level contributions.
  - `fabric.mod.json` now points to `LICENSE.md` and specifies "Custom" license type.
  - The `README.md` has been updated with a detailed, user-friendly explanation of these permissions.
  - The `LICENSE` file was renamed to `LICENSE.md` so I could make it more readable.

### Fixed
- **Hamster Guide Book Crafting and NBT Application:**
  - Fixed an issue where the crafting recipe for the Hamster Guide Book (1 Book + 1 Sliced Cucumber) would not appear or unlock correctly.
  - The recipe is now generated via datagen and produces a plain, NBT-less book.
  - A technical advancement now triggers upon crafting this plain book. The function rewarded by this advancement robustly clears any existing guidebooks from the player's inventory and then gives a single, new guidebook pre-filled with all NBT content (pages, title, author), ensuring the player always receives the complete, functional version.
- **Wild Hamster State & Animation Bug on World Load:**
  - Corrected an issue where wild hamsters would incorrectly load with their "Sitting" NBT tag as true, causing them to be stuck in a sitting animation while attempting to wander, and preventing them from sleeping or being tempted correctly.
  - `HamsterEntity` NBT save/load logic now ensures the "Sitting" tag is only saved for tamed, player-commanded sitting, and wild hamsters correctly initialize without a sitting state on load.
- **Hamster Spawning `maxGroupSize` Config Access:** Corrected the code in `ModEntitySpawns.java` to use the proper accessor path for `maxGroupSize` and `spawnWeight` from the owo-lib generated configuration, ensuring these settings are correctly applied during world generation. Due to a confirmed bug with owo-lib, the `maxGroupSize` slider mistakenly displays `0` instead of the default `1`, but this is only visual. Since the mod now uses Fzzy Config, this issue is no longer present.
- **Biome Variant Spawning:** Hamsters now spawn with the correct color variants in all intended biomes. This fixes an issue where hamsters in Stony Shores, Windswept biomes, Jungles, and other previously uncovered areas would incorrectly default to the Orange variant. Black hamsters can now also correctly spawn in the Deep Dark biome.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-05-26

### Added
- **Advanced Sleep System for Tamed Hamsters:**
  - Tamed hamsters, when commanded to sit, may now gradually drift off to sleep through a new multi-stage "Path to Slumber" animation sequence.
  - Features new animations: `anim_hamster_drifting_off` (a long, gradual doze), `anim_hamster_settle_sleep1/2/3` (short transitions), and three distinct looping sleep poses (`anim_hamster_sleep_pose1/2/3`).
  - Sleep sequence is influenced by daytime (configurable), nearby threats, and how long they've been sitting.
  - Player interactions (feeding, inventory, etc.) will now wake up a dozing/sleeping tamed hamster.
- **Configurable Sleep Timings:** New options in Mod Menu config to adjust how long tamed hamsters sit before trying to sleep, their threat detection radius for sleep, and whether daytime is required for them to get drowsy.
- **Pink Petal Cycling & Shear Removal:**
  - Right-clicking a tamed hamster with Pink Petals now cycles through three different petal decoration styles.
  - Pink petal decorations can now be removed by right-clicking the hamster with Shears (drops one pink petal).
- **Hamster Water & Fire Avoidance:** Hamsters will now try to pathfind around water, fire, and lava, making them a bit safer. Lol.
- **Shoulder Riding Sounds:**
  - Added new unique sound effects when a hamster mounts the player's shoulder (via cheese interaction).
  - Added a distinct sound effect when a hamster dismounts from the shoulder.
- **New Advancements:**
  - "Petal Pusher": Awarded for decorating a hamster with pink petals. Includes subtle sound/particle effects on first application.
  - "Pocket Paramedic": Awarded when a hamster successfully auto-feeds from its cheek pouch.
  - "Nose for Treasure": Awarded when a shoulder hamster first alerts the player to nearby diamonds.
  - "Impending Doom Squeak": Awarded when a shoulder hamster first alerts the player to a targeting Creeper.
  - "Chipmunk Aspirations": Awarded when a player fills all slots in a hamster's cheek pouch.
- **"Sweet Potato" Easter Egg (Advancement-Based):**
  - Naming a hamster "Sweet Potato" now triggers special effects (sound, particles, message) via a hidden advancement. This is a one-time effect per player. I added this for my wife since the entire mod is based on her real life hamster named Sweet Potato. She doesn't read change logs so she'll never see this. Hehe.

### Changed
- **Hamster Auto-Eating Delay:** Introduced a 2-second delay before a hamster begins to auto-eat from its cheek pouch when injured, giving players a better chance to notice the action and its effects.
- **Hamster Auto-Eating Cooldown:** Increased the cooldown after a successful auto-eat to 3 seconds (60 ticks). It was a bit overpowered.
- **Hamster Melee Attack Particles:** Changed from "poof" particles to "crit" particles, because poof particles already spawn when the attacked entity dies. Let me know If you're reading this and you have ideas for particles I should add to any of the other animations. I'm all ears! 
- **Hamster Textures:** Subtle visual enhancement to the area between the hamster's eyes for increased cuteness, especially noticeable during sleep.
- **Configuration Screen Reorganization:** Restructured the Mod Menu config screen with more descriptive top-level sections and logical sub-headers for improved clarity and ease of use. (All your settings are still there, just better organized!)
- **Wild Hamster Sleep Animation:** Wild hamsters now use a new `anim_hamster_wild_settle_sleep` transition animation before entering their looping sleep pose (`anim_hamster_sleep_pose1`).

### Fixed
- **Sliding Sit Bug:** Fixed an issue where tamed hamsters would appear to slide while in their sitting animation if they stood up to defend their owner. Animations now correctly sync with their actual sitting/standing state.
- **Body Rotation While Sitting/Sleeping/KO'd:** Hamsters will no longer rotate their bodies to look at entities while they are in a sitting, sleeping, or knocked-out state.
- **Hamster Targeting:**
  - Tamed hamsters will no longer attack other animals owned by the same player (including horses, wolves, cats, etc.) when commanded by the owner.
  - Tamed hamsters will no longer retaliate against other animals owned by the same player if accidentally hit by them.
- **Shoulder Mounting Sound:** Cheese use sound now plays at the hamster's last location, while the new hamster mount sound plays near the player's ear.

- Config option `uiTweaks.enableAutoGuidebookDelivery` to toggle automatic guidebook delivery on first join.
  - Thanks to `@MylesGit` on GitHub for suggesting those config ideas, custom advancements, and Guide Book crafting recipe.
- New hamster base color variants: Blue and Lavender.
  - Blue hamsters (with 8 overlay options) spawn rarely in Ice Spikes biomes (70% chance for Blue, 30% for White).
  - Lavender hamsters (with 8 overlay options) spawn rarely in Cherry Grove biomes.
- Four new overlay patterns (overlay5, overlay6, overlay7, overlay8) for all applicable base colors, increasing visual diversity.
- Numerous sound effect variations for hamster actions (idle, hurt, attack, sleep, beg, death, creeper detect, diamond sniff, celebrate).
- Pink Petal cosmetic overlay system:
  - Players can right-click a tamed, owned hamster with `minecraft:pink_petals` to apply one of three random pink petal textures.
  - Right-clicking again with pink petals removes the cosmetic overlay.
  - Applying consumes a petal item; removing does not.
  - Petal state is saved with the hamster and visible on the shoulder.

- Cheek Pouch Locking Mechanic:
  - By default, hamster cheek pouches are locked upon taming.
  - Feeding a hamster `HAMSTER_FOOD_MIX` for the first time (resulting in healing/love mode) permanently unlocks its pouches.
  - Plays a sound and spawns particles upon pouch unlock.

- Display a random, non-repeating message on the action bar when a shoulder hamster dismounts due to sneaking.
  - Configuration option (`features.enableShoulderDismountMessages`) to toggle shoulder dismount messages.

### Changed
- **Hamster Textures:** All hamster textures (including overlays) have been considerably reworked for improved aesthetics and to ensure they are not overly similar to textures from the "Hamsters" mod by Starfish Studios.
- **Hamster Variant System:** Breeding logic updated: If both parents have an overlay, baby must have an overlay, preferably different from parents. If one/neither parent has an overlay, baby can have an overlay (different from parents if applicable) or no overlay.
- **Shoulder Summoning:** Hamsters are now summoned to the shoulder by right-clicking a tamed, owned hamster while holding `ModItems.CHEESE` (instead of right-clicking air with cheese).
- **Hamster Tempting:** Hamsters are now also tempted by (and will beg for) `ModItems.CHEESE` and `ModItems.STEAMED_GREEN_BEANS`, in addition to `ModItems.SLICED_CUCUMBER`.
  - However, `ModItems.SLICED_CUCUMBER` is still the only thing that can tame a hamster.
- **Spawn Egg Item Model:** Now uses data generation (`Models.GENERATED`) for its model, pointing to a custom sprite texture `adorablehamsterpets:item/hamster_spawn_egg` to mesh better with the new spawn egg textures seen in Snapshot 25w08a. (Future proofing.)
- **Item/Creative Tab Icons:** Both the "Adorable Hamster Pets" creative tab and the root "The Hamster Life" advancement tab now use the (custom textured) `HAMSTER_SPAWN_EGG` as their icon.
- **Hamster Spawning:** Removed light level check from spawn restrictions to allow hamsters to spawn in dark areas like caves, provided the block below is valid.
- **Guidebook Content:** Significantly updated and expanded to reflect new features, revised mechanics, and ensure brand voice consistency. Page order adjusted.
- **Guidebook Delivery:** Initial delivery on first join now uses a persistent "flag" advancement (`technical/has_received_initial_guidebook`) to ensure it's truly one-time, respecting the config toggle. The advancement tab (`husbandry/root`) now unlocks immediately for all players via a `minecraft:location` trigger.

### Fixed
- **Melee Attack Particles:** Implemented Geckolib creator, Tslat's suggested fix; particles now spawn correctly at the attacking hamster's foot for all attacks, including the first, and in multi-entity scenarios.
- **Recipe Book Visibility:** Corrected an issue where the "Hamster Food Mix" recipe might not unlock as expected; ensured its advancement criterion correctly requires only `ModItems.SUNFLOWER_SEEDS`.
- Corrected various minor code errors and improved config access patterns.

### Removed
- Numerous hamster sound effect variations used for testing which were not intended to be present in the released version of the mod.
- Shoulder-mounted hamsters no longer dismount when the player takes damage.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-10
<!-- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with 1.0.1's release date -->

### Changed
- (Internal) Reorganized code structure and updated comments for `HamsterFleeGoal.java`, `HamsterSleepGoal.java`, `HamsterTemptGoal.java`, `HamsterShoulderFeatureRenderer.java`, and `PlayerEntityMixin.java` for improved readability.
- (Internal) Tweaked the "begging" animation to slightly shift the hamster model forward for better visual positioning (`anim_hamster.json`).

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where sitting hamsters could still be tempted by items, causing them to move while sat, which was hilarious. (`HamsterTemptGoal`).
- Corrected wild hamster sleeping behavior: they now consistently wake up when a player approaches, regardless of the player's sneaking status or held item (`HamsterSleepGoal`).
- Adjusted baby hamster rendering (`HamsterModel.java`, `HamsterRenderer.java`):
  - Corrected model scaling logic to properly apply base scales for baby/adult states while allowing JSON animations (e.g., breathing) to function proportionally.
  - Implemented differential scaling for baby hamsters, resulting in a relatively larger head compared to their body.

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` and item tooltip for the guide book to remove references to an in-book command for re-obtaining it (the book was spawning in without any content and the command to generate its content was way too long for any sane person to type.)

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-04
<!-- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with 1.0.0's release date -->

### Added
- First public version of Adorable Hamster Pets. Hello world!
